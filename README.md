# Attrition Radar

A proactive Attrition Intelligence Dashboard that uses internal signals to predict and prevent talent loss before it happens.

## Overview

Attrition Radar helps organizations predict and prevent talent loss by:
- Identifying teams and departments at risk of losing talent
- Suggesting roles to pre-source before attrition occurs
- Visualizing patterns of churn across different dimensions
- Providing actionable insights for strategic hiring

## Features

- **Attrition Risk Prediction**: Machine learning models to identify high-risk employees and teams
- **Pre-hiring Recommendations**: Smart suggestions for roles to start sourcing
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize attrition patterns and trends
- **Risk Heatmaps**: Department and region-based risk visualization
- **Attrition Timeline**: Historical trends and future predictions

## Data Sources

The system integrates multiple data sources:
- HRIS data (employee records, roles, tenure, performance)
- Attrition logs (exit reasons, feedback)
- Productivity metrics (optional)
- Industry benchmarks

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your data sources in `config.yaml`
4. Run the data pipeline:
```bash
python src/data/pipeline.py
```

5. Start the dashboard:
```bash
python src/app.py
```
